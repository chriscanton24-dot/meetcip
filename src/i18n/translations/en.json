For emergency services like plumbing leaks or HVAC failures, our AI prioritizes the call, gathers critical information quickly, and can instantly notify your on-call team via SMS or email. Regular inquiries are scheduled appropriately based on your availability.",
    "q3": "Can MeetCIP qualify leads for high-ticket services?",
    "a3": "Yes! For industries like Foundation Repair, Roofing, and Concrete Leveling, MeetCIP asks qualification questions about project scope, property details, budget range, and timeline. This helps you prioritize $15k-$50k+ opportunities and show up to appointments with complete information.",
    "q4": "Does MeetCIP really sound human? Will customers know it's AI?",
    "a4": "MeetCIP uses advanced voice AI that sounds natural and conversational. Most customers don't realize they're speaking with AI. The system is trained to handle interruptions, ask clarifying questions, and maintain a professional, friendly tone in both English and Spanish.",
    "q5": "How quickly can I get set up?",
    "a5": "Most businesses are live within 24-48 hours. Setup includes: (1) Choosing your industry package, (2) Connecting your phone number, (3) Training the AI on your business details, (4) Testing calls. Our team handles the technical work - you just provide information about your services.",
    "q6": "What happens if MeetCIP can't answer a question?",
    "a6": "If a caller asks something outside MeetCIP's knowledge, it will politely explain that it needs to connect them with your team, take their contact information, and immediately notify you. You maintain full control and can always jump into any conversation.",
