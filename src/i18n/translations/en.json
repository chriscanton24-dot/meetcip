    "a1": "MeetCIP uses advanced AI to answer your business phone calls 24/7. When a customer calls, our AI greets them professionally, answers their questions using your business information, captures their details, and notifies you instantly. You can customize responses, set business hours, and train the AI with your specific FAQs.",
    "q2": "Can MeetCIP handle calls in Spanish?",
    "a2": "Yes! MeetCIP is fully bilingual in English and Spanish. It automatically detects the caller's language and responds naturally in that language. This is included in all plans at no extra cost.",
    "q3": "What happens to the calls MeetCIP answers?",
    "a3": "Every call is recorded (with proper disclosure), transcribed, and logged in your dashboard. You'll receive instant notifications for high-priority calls, and can review all call transcripts, recordings, and caller information anytime. Everything is searchable and exportable.",
    "q4": "Does MeetCIP really sound human? Will customers know it's AI?",
    "a4": "MeetCIP uses advanced voice AI that sounds natural and conversational. Most customers don't realize they're speaking with AI. The system is trained to handle interruptions, ask clarifying questions, and maintain a professional, friendly tone in both English and Spanish.",
    "q5": "How quickly can I get set up?",
    "a5": "Most businesses are live within 24-48 hours. Setup includes: (1) Choosing your industry package, (2) Connecting your phone number, (3) Training the AI on your business details, (4) Testing calls. Our team handles the technical work - you just provide information about your services.",
    "q6": "What happens if MeetCIP can't answer a question?",
    "a6": "If a caller asks something outside MeetCIP's knowledge, it will politely explain that it needs to connect them with your team, take their contact information, and immediately notify you. You maintain full control and can always jump into any conversation.",
